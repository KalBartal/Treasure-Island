## Usage

```
Welcome to Treasure Island.
Your mission is to find the treasure.

You're at a cross road. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"

You've come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.

You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose?

You found the treasure! You Win!
